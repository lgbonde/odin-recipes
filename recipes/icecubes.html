        <figcaption>The classic ice cube that everyone enjoys!

        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups of water (approximately)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water (additional if needed)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Empty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if there are any left) into the bin (if included with freezer).</li>
            <li>Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more clear).</li>
            <li>Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.</li>
            <li>Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it.</li>
            <li>Shut the door to the freezer.</li>
            <li>Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen.</li>
            <li>If you want to experiment, you can freeze things like fruit infused waters or juices.</li>
          </ol>
